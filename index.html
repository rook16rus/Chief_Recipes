                    <p class="biography-description">A conversation with Nikollo Pianti and Bianka Spinosa.</p>
                    <p class="first-lettered">
                        Chef Pianti began his career in the kitchen of a small cafe in northwestern Italy, run by his
                        mother,
                        and then moved to Rome and worked under the direction of the famous chef Georgio Notti. In the
                        late
                        1980s, he opened a restaurant in Venice, but the business did not go well and had to be closed.
                        Nicollo decided not to give up, and went to study with the masters of cooking. And so, in 2019,
                        his
                        restaurant Lusardi's received 5 Michelin stars and won many other awards. Nicollo is now opening
                        a
                        new restaurant in the heart of Italy.

            <p>If you had to describe your philosophy on cooking, what would you say?</p>
            <p class="text-author">Nikollo Pianti</p>
            <p>
                Combining traditions and searching for new combinations. I am constantly experimenting, mixing, may say,
                I
                invent new dishes. But sometimes, there is nothing tastier than my dear grandmother's gnocchi!
            </p>
            <p>
                <span class="text-author">(B.S.)</span>Can you describe the moment when you learned that cooking –
                creating
                new recipes – is for you?
            </p>
            <p>
                <span class="text-author">(N.P.)</span>When in a restaurant, my first job, guests praised my food. This
                restaurant has
                become
                very popular, even famous in or town, I certainly think it was thanks to me (laughing). I knew the
                guests,
                tried to surprise them, and that's how all started.
            </p>
            <p><span class="text-author">(B.S.)</span>So why did your first restaurant close?</p>
            <p>
                <span class="text-author">(N.P.)</span>At that time, I was sure that I already knew everything, I cook
                better than all the
                chefs
                in the world. But
                in fact, I cooked the best only in my small town. I had to learn. And learn not only cooking, but
                management, business, finance and much more.
            </p>
            <p>
                <span class="text-author">(B.S.)</span>You probably have your own rules in the kitchen. Which ones are
                the strictest?
            </p>
            <p>
                <span class="text-author">(N.P.)</span>I would not say that I have my own rules. These are rather the
                generally accepted
                norms
                in good restaurants. Always be neat, leave personal problems outside the restaurant door, do not take
                them
                with you to the kitchen. And of course about the products: no unnatural, stale products, additives,
                chemicals. The most important thing for us is the quality of the food.

                <span class="text-author">(B.S.)</span>Recently you have published a new recipe book. I already bought
                it and even cooked some dishes, they are amazing! I cook rarely and I really liked that the recipes are
                easy and fast.
            </p>
            <p>
                <span class="text-author">(N.P.)</span>Oh, I'm so glad you liked it! In fact, it was intended, this is
                the main idea of ​​the book. So that everyone can cook food like in a restaurant, without spending the
                whole day on cooking. The book was published quite recently, but we are already preparing a reprint, as
                many new recipes have appeared. And this time, we took into account the seasonality and add recipes for
                holiday dishes. I suppose, many housewives prepare for the holidays in advance. So take a note, don't
                plan your Christmas menu until we release an update (laughing)!
            </p>
            <p>
                <span class="text-author">(B.S.)</span>Very soon you are opening a restaurant in Rome, the heart of
                Italy. Tell us if there will be new dishes on the menu, how will you surprise your guests?
            </p>
            <p>
                <span class="text-author">(N.P.)</span>If now I tell you how I am going to surprise, then at the opening
                nobody will be surprised (laughing)! Of course, new positions have appeared on the menu, my team and I
                are not standing at one place. I can only say that you will not try this anywhere. Come to our opening,
                we will wait for everyone!
